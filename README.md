# Taakmeester

An app which will automatically process data and calculate variables of interest to a farmer. This information can be used to create task maps. The app will also have a functionality that enables manual adjustment of variables before creation of a task map.

### Steps

1. Crop NDVI image based on field boundaries
2. Built a grid of 6x6 meter
3. Calculate mean NDVI per grid cell
4. Calculate NDVI to [factor_of_interst]
5. Visualize grid on map
6. Enable changing values per gridcell
7. Export required output (shapefiles for task mapping software)
